# 🧪 Linux Users, Groups, and Account Profiles Lab (Rocky Linux)

This lab explores foundational user and group management tasks on a RHEL-based system (Rocky Linux). It is structured as a hands-on study tool aligned with key objectives of the CompTIA Linux+ exam.
The lab is split into two focused phases:

## Phase 1: User & Group Management

Create, modify, and delete user accounts and groups using tools like useradd, usermod, groupadd, and passwd. You'll also verify changes using commands like id, groups, and by inspecting /etc/passwd and /etc/group.
📝 Reference: usersgroups.md

## Phase 2: Account Profiles & Login Behavior

Customize user environments using /etc/skel, .bashrc, and login.defs. You'll learn how to modify default settings, apply custom aliases, and track login activity through system logs and commands like last and lastlog.
📝 Reference: profiles.md
