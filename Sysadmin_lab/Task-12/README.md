## Task 12 - Automating Backups with Cron and Bash

In this task, I created a simple automated backup system using a Bash script and scheduled it to run daily using `cron`.

I worked on `server2` to:
- Create a folder named `docs` with a test file.
- Write a Bash script that compresses the `docs` folder into a timestamped `.tar.gz` archive.
- Schedule that script to run every day at 2 AM via `cron`.

### 🛠️ Bash Script: `backup.sh`

This script does two things:
1. Creates a `/home/admin/backup` directory if it doesn't already exist.
2. Compresses the `/home/admin/docs` folder into a `.tar.gz` file with the current date in the filename.

### 📁 Create Source Directory and Test File

I created a `docs` folder and added a simple text file to simulate backup content.

### 🧪 Attempt #1: Run the Script (spoiler: it didn't work)

Despite being executable and visibly present… the script threw a bizarre `file not found` error. Cue Linux sorcery. 🔮

### 🔎 Investigation: The Mystery Bug 🕵️

This is where things got weird.

I wrote the script *manually* in `nano` on the server itself — no copy/pasting, no external editing — and still received a “file not found” error when trying to run it using `./backup.sh`.

The typical cause for this is a `^M` carriage return character (from Windows-style line endings), especially after the `#!/bin/bash` line — but in this case, we couldn't confirm that was present. We ran `cat -v` and `file backup.sh` and things *looked* normal.

So, the true cause is still unknown — possibly some kind of encoding or terminal quirk. The important thing is…

### 🔧 Internet Workaround for `dos2unix`

Naturally, `server2` had no internet access because it was on a private, isolated lab network.  
To install `dos2unix`, we had to:

1. Edit `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml`
2. Switch from static IP to DHCP
3. Change the VM to use NAT
4. Install the package
5. Switch everything back

…and after all that, it still didn’t fix the issue.

### 💡 Final Fix: Just Use Bash

After a few choice words and some tactical pacing, I got the script working by simply running:

```bash
bash backup.sh` instead of `./backup.sh

```

This bypasses whatever mysterious execution problem existed and directly calls the interpreter. Sometimes it’s not worth finding the ghost — just use holy water and move on.

### 💥 Bonus: Automating with Cron

Once we verified the script worked, we added it to the crontab for the `admin` user.

We used this:
0 2 * * * /home/admin/backup.sh

### 🔚 Summary

✅ Created a working backup system using Bash and cron  
✅ Encountered a strange execution issue — probably encoding-related, but unconfirmed  
✅ Installed `dos2unix`, updated network settings, still had to fallback to `bash backup.sh`  
✅ Got everything running and verified that backups are being created correctly  
✅ Left a small offering to the shell gods in thanks

> 💬 Lesson learned: Sometimes it’s not your code — it’s hidden ghosts from the system or terminal environment. Be suspicious of everything, especially when the error makes no sense.
