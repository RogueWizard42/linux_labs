# linux_labs

Welcome to `linux_labs` — my personal forge for mastering the Linux operating system.

This repo is where I build, break, fix, and explore Linux through a growing collection of hands-on projects. It’s part documentation, part lab journal, and part roadmap toward becoming a confident and skilled Linux user.

## 🎯 What This Repo Is About

This isn’t just about memorizing commands — it’s about **understanding how Linux really works** by doing it.

Inside you’ll find:

- 🖥️ **Network lab projects** – Using multiple VMs to simulate real-world server/client scenarios
- 🧪 **OS exploration** – Diving into Debian, Arch, RPM-based distros, and everything in between
- 🧰 **Bash + Python scripting** – Automating tasks with the right tool for the job
- 🏗️ **Custom builds** – Including a future Arch Linux setup and eventually, a Linux From Scratch journey
- 📦 **Virtualization** – Leveraging VMware to spin up complex test environments
- 💻 **CLI-first mindset** – I really dig working with the command line, but I'll fire up a code editor when I can too.

## 🔐 Security Curious?  

While the focus here is general-purpose Linux mastery, I’ll also be dabbling in **Kali Linux** and security-related content.  
Those deeper rabbit holes will be documented over in [`dark_arts_lab`](https://github.com/RogueWizard42/dark_arts_lab) as that repo grows.

## 👨‍🏫 Who’s This For?

- New Linux learners
- Sysadmin students
- Rogue hackers looking for hands-on practice
- Or… just me, trying to get really good at this and have some fun along the way

## ⚡ The Goal

To sharpen my Linux skills, push beyond surface-level tutorials, and create something I can look back on and say:  
_"Yeah — I built that. And I get how it works."_
