## Task 11 ‚Äì Final Topology and Private Network Diagram

This task wraps up the core lab setup by visualizing the simplified private network we've built using **Packet Tracer**.

The updated topology consists of three machines:

- **Server1** ‚Äì Ubuntu Server (Main controller node)
- **Mint** ‚Äì Desktop client
- **Lubuntu** ‚Äì Lightweight desktop client

---

### üß† Network Design Summary

- All three machines are connected using **Fast Ethernet** cables
- Each device is assigned a **static IP** within the `10.99.99.0/24` subnet
- The network is completely **isolated** using VMware's `vmnet99` (host-only adapter)
- All devices can communicate with each other ‚Äî verified via ping tests

### üñºÔ∏è Diagram

The complete topology is documented in the following files:

- `basicprivate.png` ‚Äì Static image of the network layout  
- `basicprivate.pkt` ‚Äì Interactive Packet Tracer file

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This network is intentionally simple for learning purposes. A more advanced, multi-segmented network will be created in a future project.
