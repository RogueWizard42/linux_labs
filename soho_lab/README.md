# SOHO Network Lab

This project builds upon the foundational work in the `Sysadmin_lab` by exploring how to design, configure, and simulate a small office/home office (SOHO) network. The goal is to create a realistic, functional setup similar to what many users might have at home or in a remote-work scenario.

## Purpose

To expand practical skills in small network design, virtual machine provisioning, and basic networking concepts. This lab offers a hands-on opportunity to reinforce core IT knowledge while showcasing your ability to structure and document technical projects clearly.

## Tools & Prerequisites

- Linux command line basics 
- A modern hypervisor of your choice  
  _(This project was developed using VMware Workstation Pro 17.x. Your experience may differ slightly if using VirtualBox, Hyper-V, or another platform.)_
- Some familiarity with virtual machine installation, network adapter settings, and basic Linux administration.

## Lab Overview

This lab will walk through the process of:

- Creating a handful of virtual machines representing common SOHO endpoints (e.g., laptops, desktops, printers).
- Connecting those machines to a simulated router and outward to the internet.
- Exploring how IP addressing, routing, and basic connectivity work in a contained virtual environment.

The core of the lab will be designed around a Packet Tracer topology, which will serve as the blueprint for building and configuring the virtual network. That topology will be uploaded and referenced as the first step in the lab.

## What You Might Learn

- More advanced VM setup, including storage, adapters, and installation methods
- Subnetting and addressing planning for small environments
- Router and switch configuration basics
- How to document a working lab for future use or professional demonstration
